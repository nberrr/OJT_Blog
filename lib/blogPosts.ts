    description: "My first week of OJT was filled with new faces, unfamiliar systems, and unexpected challenges.",
    content: `
      <p>My first week at the company was a whirlwind of new experiences. I arrived early on Monday, nervous but excited about what lay ahead. The office was larger than I expected, with an open floor plan that seemed designed to encourage collaboration.</p>
      <h2>Delayed Start but Productive Beginning</h2>
      <p> Our deployment was delayed due to paperwork issues, making us three weeks late from the original schedule. However, as we officially began Week 1, we made sure to maximize our time and productivity.</p>
      <p> This week, we focused on setting up our workspace—installing PCs, crimping and setting up LAN cables, and organizing our workstations. We actively participated in meetings and were assigned our tasks. The major task, called the "Rock Task," revolves around a system we'll be working on, while our minor tasks involve other responsibilities. I was assigned to collateral report layout, which aligns with my other skills.</p>
      <p>Determined to make the most of our first week, I worked on wireframing, layout design, and even tried creating a mock-up logo for the system. Despite the late start, we ensured a productive week, setting a strong foundation for the coming days.

    content: `
     <p>Week two was all about finding my rhythm and establishing routines. The initial overwhelm began to subside as I became more familiar with the office environment and daily procedures.</p>

<p>Our OJT coordinator also visited us during the week to check in and speak with our on-site supervisors about our progress and overall performance.</p>

<h2>Diving into Tasks</h2>
<p>This week marked the real start of our hands-on work in the Management Information System (MIS) Department. With guidance from the employees, we got deeper into our assigned tasks and adapted to the workflow.</p>
<p>One of my key focuses was wireframing, ensuring that the structure of our project was well-planned and visually organized. We attended meetings to align our progress, submitted our weekly report, and underwent a realignment of tasks to ensure everyone was on track.</p>
<p>To start by Week 3, I was also assigned the task of revising brochures, improving their layout and content to make them more engaging and professional. This involved careful attention to design and formatting while making sure the message remained clear and effective.</p>
<p>Our weekly meetings were a crucial part of our routine. We discussed our progress, addressed any issues, and planned our next steps. The meetings were structured to ensure everyone was on the same page and to facilitate collaboration.</p>
<p>Throughout the week, we continued learning from our mentors, gaining insights into best practices and problem-solving approaches in MIS. It was a productive and insightful week, setting a strong foundation for the tasks ahead!</p>

    description: "Week three brought my first significant project and the pressure that came with it.",
    content: `
      <p>Week three marked a significant shift in my OJT experience as I faced my first real challenge. The comfortable routine I had begun to establish was disrupted, pushing me out of my comfort zone and testing my abilities.</p>
      <h2>The Rock Task</h2>
<p>This week marked the beginning of actual development as we started coding the front end of the RSTL Appointment Portal. With most of the wireframes finalized, we focused on building the layout, ensuring the interface aligns with the planned user experience.</p>
  <p>Final touches were made to the wireframes to lock in structure and flow, giving us a clear path forward. It felt good to shift from planning to seeing our design take shape on screen.</p>
  <p>Midweek, we joined an earthquake drill, a brief but important reminder to stay prepared and flexible, qualities that also help during unexpected bugs or issues in development.</p>
  <p>One of the highlights was meeting with the RSTL end users and admin. We shared our progress and gathered their input, which helped us better understand their needs and expectations. Their feedback was insightful and will guide improvements moving forward.</p>
  <p>Week 3 was productive and motivating, a solid step from concept to code, backed by collaboration and real-world feedback.</p>

      <p>Week four centered around collaboration and teamwork. After the intensity of last week's individual challenge, this week provided valuable lessons in working effectively with others and the power of collective effort.</p>
      <h2>Still Building, With One Less Hand</h2>
      <p>This week, we continued coding the front end of the RSTL Appointment Portal. Progress is steady as we work on bringing the system’s interface and functionality to life. Each step forward is a reminder of how far we've come since planning.</p>
      <p>We also had a hands-on lecture on server upgrading. It was a valuable learning experience that gave us a clearer understanding of the backend side of the system and how to prepare it for deployment. This session added depth to our technical knowledge and made us more aware of the full system architecture.</p>
      <p>Amidst the progress, we also experienced a bit of loss. One of our project technical assistants, Kuya Vince, resigned. He had been one of our Kuyas throughout this journey, quietly helping and guiding us. His departure was unexpected and left us feeling a little incomplete as a team. Still, we’re thankful for the time he was with us and for everything he contributed.</p>
      <p>As Week 4 ends, we carry on with development — growing as a team, learning as we go, and adjusting to changes along the way.</p>

      <p>Week four centered around collaboration and teamwork. After the intensity of last week's individual challenge, this week provided valuable lessons in working effectively with others and the power of collective effort.</p>
      <h2>Celebrating Women’s Month with Care and Progress</h2>
      <p>Week 5 was both productive and refreshing as we continued our development tasks while also celebrating the peak of Women’s Month. The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) prepared a special treat for everyone — a buffet and a free pamper day with services from head to toe, including massages, haircuts, and more.</p>
      <p>We were invited to enjoy the services too. I personally got a haircut and a relaxing hand massage, while some of my co-interns made the most of the experience by availing every service offered. It was a thoughtful gesture that truly lifted everyone's spirits.</p>
      <p>The DOST lobby was also livelier than usual, with booths selling various products — from snacks to small items, creating a mini marketplace vibe that added to the festive atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Despite the celebration, development didn’t stop. We continued working on the systems assigned with the same drive and focus. It was a great reminder that taking care of people goes hand in hand with moving forward in our work.</p>

    description: "A week of design, system progress, team presentations, and updated inventory.",
    content: `
      <p>Week 6 came with a full set of tasks that pushed us to manage our time and responsibilities carefully. One of our assignments was to create a draft layout for our internship ID. It was a fun and creative break from our usual system work. After finalizing our designs, we also laminated the IDs ourselves, which made the experience feel more hands-on and personal.</p>
      <h2>Designing, Presenting, and Progressing</h2>
      <p>A key part of this week was our progress report presentation. Each team presented updates on their systems to our head and senior programmer. It was a chance to showcase what we’ve accomplished so far and get valuable feedback. I was given the opportunity to present my contribution to the RSTL Appointment Portal, specifically the UI/UX design of the admin dashboard. I explained the flow, layout decisions, and how the design supports user needs. It was a proud moment to articulate the work I’ve done and see how it fits into the bigger system.</p>
      <p>Aside from development and presentations, we also received new supplies this week. These were added to our tools and resources for working more efficiently. We took the time to update our inventory list to make sure everything was documented properly — a reminder that even small details matter when working as a team.</p>
      <p>This week helped us balance creativity, technical progress, and team responsibility. As we move forward, we carry with us the feedback we received and a stronger sense of ownership over our roles in the project.</p>
